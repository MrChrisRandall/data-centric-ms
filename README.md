PROJECT NAME

"Company Blog" by Christopher Randall

In this project I wanted to create a website dedicated to blogging, specifically a workplace/lifestyle blog for company employees.

UX

This website is  dedicated solely to a companies blog post site for employees to go and blog about their day or an aspect of work that week or even to keep people who may know or follow said person up to date with the working life/lifestyle.

FEATURES

This website features a registration aspect, login aspect, creation of blog post along with readability, update feature and delete feature. It also made sure that to edit a blog post the initial user who created the post must be logged in as to prevent any random user from editing any post they see fit. The main page of the site would showcase blogs written by different user which included the date and time in which it was posted along with a link to the users page. A custom 404 Error page and also a custom 403 Forbidden Access page were also to be implemented.

TECHNOLOGIES USED

Technologies used were as follows:

- HTML5 to build the templates.

- CSS to style the site.

- Python + Flask was used to build the backend and add almost all of the features seen here.

- SQL Alchemy was the database I chose to go with.

My automated tests for this project are as follows:

- Initially running the app with success using the terminal.

- Testing the forms and also that the blog posts were in fact posting correctly.

- Testing that the registration of multiple accounts with the same email address would throw an error.

- Testing that only the blog post creator could edit the posts.

My steps to deploying my project were as follows:

- I first created a new repository on GitHub.

- Next I changed my Source to Master branch in the repository settings.

- Next I opened my new repository in Atom Text Editor.

- Running the app came in the form of the terminal window.

- Once satisfied with the days progress I would commit my code.

- Then I would pushed my code from Atom to the repository.

- Finally the project was deployed and hosted on Heroku.
